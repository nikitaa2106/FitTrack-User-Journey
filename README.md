# FitTrack – User Journey Prototype  

## 📌 About the Project  
This project is an interactive prototype that demonstrates the user journey of a fictional fitness app called **FitTrack**. The prototype covers:  
- Welcome & onboarding  
- Profile setup  
- Fitness goal selection  
- Guided navigation flow  

## UX Design Decisions
- Reduced onboarding steps to minimize user drop-off  
- Progressive profile setup instead of long forms  
- Goal-based personalization for better retention  

The focus is on UX flow rather than full functionality.
